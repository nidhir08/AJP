EXPERIMENT 4
AIM
N soldiers (or people) stand in a circle. The king gives a sword to the first soldier, who kills the person to their left and passes the sword to the next surviving person. This process continues until only one person remains. Write a java program to find the safe position to stand. Assuming first position is=1. 


CODE
import java.util.Scanner;
public class josephus {
   public static int josephus(int n, int k){
       if(n==1){
       return 1;
       } else {
           return (josephus(n-1, k)+k-1)% n +1;
       }   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       System.out.print("Enter number of people \t");
       int n = sc.nextInt();
       int k = 2; //every 2nd person is killed
       int safePosition = josephus(n, k);
       System.out.println("Safe position is " + safePosition);
       sc.close();
   }}
